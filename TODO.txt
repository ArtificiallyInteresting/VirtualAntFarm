Add colony behavior
GAs

genes can just be "probability of move success". Maybe probability of better move order?

Colonies can use food to generate new ants
Ants can be worker ants or fighter ants. Only fighter ants can kill enemies, only workers can build tunnels and gather food.
Metal resource?
Maybe some kind of other colony investment with food?

Things should be seaparated into early/mid/late game

Maybe: If I see a place that I've seen before, I can pop off from my return list however many steps its been since I was there.
Colonies should be able to signal to all ants that its under attack.

For the MVP:
Ants genes have hunger and max health
Ants fight each other. Simply the distance between their health
When ants are hurt at all, they go back to base
When a game ends, the next one starts.
