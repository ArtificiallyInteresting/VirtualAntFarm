Board Generation
Ants and colonies should have a "colony knowledge", only updated when returning to colony (or when it sees an ant with a more updated version?)
-Colonies always have the updated knowledge. This is the one part that's "magic"
Favor higher distance from the colony as a tiebreaker (probabilistically)
genes can just be "probability of move success". Maybe probability of better move order?
Saw it move towards the colony when it should have moved away :(

New ant exploration:
-Randomly pick a 'goal' point
-Explore to there, stop to get food on the way
-When goal point is reached, randomly select new goal point
